# tinder-detective
Stalk your friends on Tinder. Don't actually do that. It's just a description of what this code does.

To run it using Python 3, just do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
You'll then need to answer "y" to a prompt asking you if you really want to look at your real-life friends' Tinder profiles. Otherwise the app will quit.
If you answer "y", the app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.


# Why did you make this?
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
